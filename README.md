# Modulize x Richard Devegili interview

## This repository is dedicated to Modulize's interview studies about BIM, IFC, and other concepts.

The **Python version** employed on this project is **3.9**.

Inside the [/experiments](/experiments) folder are the little tests I did until the moment of our interview.

Inside the [/notes](/notes) folder are the notes for every file on the experiments folder, some useful tools, my experience until now with IFC, and other notes I might add in the future while I learn new things about this area of knowledge.

Olav, Lucas, and HÃ¥kon, thank you for the opportunity to keep learning, to keep pursuing knowledge.

Richard Devegili
