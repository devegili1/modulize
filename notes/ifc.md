# IFC

In general, I learned that BIM and IFC are not as complex as I thought they were. Their goal is simple: to facilitate design, construction, and operation processes.
What might be complex at first, are their specifications and, about IFC files specifically, their structure.
The file of a small object has a relatively small structure complexity, also a small file size. But that changes completely when working with real-world projects, of real-world buildings, the structure of the files gets complex, the files get heavier, and parsing them gets harder because of the number of details involved.
To be honest, before getting in touch with Modulize, I did not know anything about those concepts, and I still know almost nothing (but will certainly keep studying about them).
