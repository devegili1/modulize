## [wall_build.py](../experiments/wall_build.py)
This one was based on different articles and small tutorials I could find on the internet (there aren't many yet, maybe it is our time to start spreading this knowledge with the world?!).
I intended to build a wall with a window on it that resembled Modulize's logo (including the "M", which is a lot harder than I expected).
I did not finish it yet, and I plan to do it, I truly enjoyed making this...
